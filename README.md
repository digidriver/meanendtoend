# meanendtoend
A quick demo built using the MEAN stack. Dependencies include:

- Express
- Mongoose (I think it's for slightly "better" MongoDB database processing)
- Body Parser (comes in handy on the server)

# Notes / Misc
- I placed my files in a folder called "mean-demo".
- Mongoose's connect parameters can be found on the server.js file (your port number may vary from mine, which was 27017).
- While it might not be necessary to return a JSON response after performing server ops, it sure helps if you need to debug! #lessonlearned
